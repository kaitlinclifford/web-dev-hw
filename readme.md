 # My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo
 ## Kaitlin Clifford

 I am a Media Arts Major here at the University, and this Intro to Web Design class is part of my curriculum so I needed to take it in order to get my degree. I feel it's also going to be nice to learn about websites and what goes into them since I really have no idea.

From reading about the internet, it was cool to learn that:
- nobody, and everybody is incharge of the internet. It is made up of many independently operated networks, and there's no central control to decide how things happen on the internet. Instead it's business decisions made by the operators.
- the internet, and the web are two different things. The internet connects participants, while the web connects information, specifically hypertext files accessed via the internet. When I talk about the internet, I always assumed they were the same thing and had no idea they actually were different.
- The deep web makes up 80% of the entire world wide web! I knew that the deep web was a big part, but I had no idea it was 80%.
