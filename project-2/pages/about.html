          My name is Kaitlin Clifford, and I'm a Media Arts student
          at the University of Montana. I'm still new to the whole
          Media Arts thing, but I'm really enjoying it so far. Every
          day is exciting because I get to create different projects.

          This site is a project for my Web Design class. I chose to
          do a recipe on how to make rice crispy treats because everyone
          should know how to make these delicious treats. I'm sure most
          people have made them before, but if not, I wanted to make a
          place where people could make them easily.

          On this page, you will see that I've included the address for
          a walmart where you can find all of the ingredients to make,
          these treats at home, as well as a song that can get you
          fired up while you make these treats. I do have to warn you
          that the song I have picked for you is in Korean, however, even
          if you can't understand it, that doesn't mean this song isn't
          popping!
